  <div class="article"><p>New Year resolutions are dumb. I made them for many years to witness them crumble within the first few days. They are the wrong device to use for mmmm! anything. With that in mind, I write these notes to myself. You and me already know that these are resolutions in disguise. Old habits die hard.</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>I start many courses online and most of them lay unfinished. However, in 2022, I finished a course on digital photography on LinkedIn Learning and last Black Friday sale, I bought the Ruby and Ruby on Rails course from Pragmatic Studio which I'm going through and having fun going through it.</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed writing Ruby code but somehow I have never pursued a job writing Ruby. I plan to change this and find a contract where I work on Ruby on Rails. I don't understand why some people find it RoR hard, to me it makes total sense. I am at a point where I find RoR and Django to be the most complete and sensible frameworks to write web applications or APIs.</p>
<p>The learning in this area shall continue as long as it remains fun.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>To me reading is a lot of things. It is a hobby, a stress reliever, boredom buster and the best return on the time spent. It is hard to find a pursuit which gives delivers all these things. Yet, somehow I did not do much of it. These are the only books I read last year.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dark Emu</li>
<li>Wolf of the Plains</li>
<li>How to Take Smart Notes</li>
<li>Richer, Wiser, Happer</li>
<li>The Rebel Allocator</li>
<li>Deep Survival</li>
<li>Viral</li>
<li>TITAN</li>
<li>Breath</li>
<li>The Polymath</li>
</ol>
<p>The number does not matter at all, but this is embarrassing. I'm sure that I can do better.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>Let's start with a confession. I have sinned and my sin is gluttony. Ever since I started cooking myself, I have became more of a foodie than I was. This has started to show around the belly. My plan is to consume only 1 full meal a day which includes carbs. Other two will be broken up into smaller meals of mostly healthy food such as fruits, yoghurt, nuts etc. </p>
<p>Exercise is another area which needs to be worked on 2023. I somehow could never make it a part of my day and I plan to change this. Maybe I could apply lessons I learned form Atomic Habits.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>Last few years have not been too good on travel side. When I did travel, it was because of family emergencies or taking care of things. Hopefully this year will be different. I have already made plans for some travel in the first and second quarter of this year. I'll post photos if those trips materialize.</p>
<p>Now this is already becoming longer that I expected. I think I'll end it here. </p>
<p>Happy New Year.</p>
