  <div class="article"><p>You most likely don't need microservices.</p>
<p>Fad is defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an intense and widely shared enthusiasm for something, especially one that is short-lived; a craze.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to programming or application architecture, the definition is spot on. Maybe the short-lived part can be removed.</p>
<p>Since last few years, I have noticed the use of microservices as the goto architecture for back-end services. Although the infection has now crept up in the front-end world too. Micro-frontends? Seriously?</p>
<p>But let's stick to microservices for now.</p>
<p>You may not need them because you don't have those problems to which are solved by microservices. You are not Netflix, Google, Facebook...</p>
<p>Stop pretending that you are. Oh yes, and when/if you do become that big, then you will have an army of engineers to deal with it.</p>
<p>There, I said it.</p>
<p>Now go embrace a monolith.</p>
