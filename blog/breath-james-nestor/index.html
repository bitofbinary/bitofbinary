  <div class="article"><p>Breath: The new science of a lost art by James Nestor.</p>
<p>What is one activity that we do constantly from the moment we are born to the second we die? The answer is breathing.</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of importance, breathing is way on top above everything else. Think about it. Without breathing there is no you and without you, there is nothing.</p>
<p>Sadly, I did not think too much about breathing until I read this book. I have been aware of breathing techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama">pranayam</a> but I never looked into it's benefits or practiced it. This book changed that for me.</p>
<p>The author describes (not in too much detail) many breathing techniques. I was able to practice few of them while reading. I thought, that there is no equipment required or any special arrangement and I have got everything I need to try it out. So, I made it a habit to breath slowly with longer exhales while I was reading.</p>
<p>There were few things I noticed in me while I did slow, deep breathing. I generally felt lighter and happier. I also noticed a change in my energy levels which were high after focused breathing. Overall, I was in a good mood.</p>
<p>These results created a positive feedback loop and I have made it a habit to breath conciously, slowly and deeply.</p>
<p>It could be one of the most important books I have read.</p>
