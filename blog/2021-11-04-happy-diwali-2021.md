# Happy Diwali 2021

A lot has happened this year. Many people I know lost loved ones. I wish them strength and courage.

असतो मा सद्गमय ।

तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।

मृत्योर्माऽमृतं गमय ॥

From evil lead me to good,
From darkness lead me to light,
From death lead me to immortality.

With gratitude, Happy Diwali.
