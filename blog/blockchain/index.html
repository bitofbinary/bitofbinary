  <div class="article"><p>Last year (2021), I was approached by at least four to five organisations for positions which would have lifted my career to new heights. Some of these approaches were direct via LinkedIn and others were by recuriters. A common thread was that all except one of these positions had something to do with Blockchain.</p>
<p>The non-blockchain position sounded interesting and I agreed to meet the founder of the company. It was a well funded profitable startup and I had a long and interesting discussion with the founder. The founder and his partner developed a product which was one of a kind in the world. It was a SAAS product which was used to manage blockchain transactions for users. We went into some details of their stack and it turned out that it was a tried and tested RoR application with a RDBMS backend. They had figured out that it was more rewarding selling shovels then mining for gold. It got me interested and I continued asking him about the future plans. The plan I was told was to move the rig to their own blockchain and re-write the entire thing. This is what they wanted me to be a part of. It turned out that this too was a blockchain gig. No thanks! I said and moved on.</p>
<p>I always thought that blockchain was a hype which would end at some point and leave a lot of companies on life support. All we needed was a big failure and every buzz word CIO/CTO will start calling BS on the whole thing. That big failure was delivered this month when ASX pulled the plug on their ambitions of moving to a blockchain platform. </p>
<p>In it's early days this move by ASX was received as the most welcome news by blockchian aficionados. Here was a stock exchange of a developed country moving everything to blockchain. The future was blockchain and if you are not with it then you will be left behind. What other endorsement do you need? A stock exchange which deals with real money and not some BS like NFTs was going all blockchain. There were also a few dumb Australian banks which also got onto the bandwagon and made some big announcements of their blockchain ambitions. But nothing compared to what ASX had planned. All of those entangled dreams came crashing when they finally admitted that it ain't gonna happen.</p>
<p>I don't think there is anything wrong with the technology. It has some excellent use cases and in the future we will see it being adapted to address some genuine problems. The problem as we tech folks say is between the chair the keyboard. It is people's interpretation and expectation of a magical solution to a problem which does not exist. </p>
<p>I have stayed clear of the hype many times in my career and I plan to stick with this approach. </p>
<p>Boring can be good and profitable.</p>
