  <div class="article"><p>I have been reading books since many years and there have been times when I would read one book after another for months. There were also times when I would not pick up a book. A lot of reading happened on my commute to and from work and I figured that it was the best way to spend the commute time.</p>
<p>One of the things I never took seriously was keeping a track of what I read. For a while, I had a Goodreads account which I would update but I never took it seriously.</p>
<p>The other day I was looking at my library and randomly flipping through books. A thought occurred to me that I should make an effort to catalogue all the books I have read.</p>
<p>But how would I do that?</p>
<p>Whenever I finish a book and if it is a printed copy (they mostly are), I write the date I finished reading it on the last page. I don't know how I got into this habit but it is something I have been doing for years. This habit has come in handy for this project.</p>
<p>I don't think I'll be able to add all the read books to this catalogue but hopefully I should be able to get around 80% coverage.</p>
