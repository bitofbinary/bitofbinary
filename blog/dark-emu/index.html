<p>My rating: ★★★</p>
<p>Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians">Aboriginals</a>. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.</p>
