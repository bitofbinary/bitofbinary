  <div class="article"><p>Since last 5 plus years, I have been working remotely for most of the time. I started doing this before COVID pandamic. These are some of the thoughts I have on remote working.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-it-start-for-me">How did it start for me</h2>
<p>CIRCA 2017, I joined an organisation where I developed the first React based system for that company. The work was fun and the team was great. My kids were young at that time, and I wanted to be involved in some of their after-school activities. Because the job was about an hour commute each way, it became challenging for me to get home on time and be a part of kids' activities. </p>
<p>I asked my manager if working from home on some of the days was a possibility and he denied. It was not the reply I was expecting and it got me thinking about the work and family life balance. After giving it some thought for few days, I decided that I will resign and look for something else. I went to my manager to convey my decision and he asked me to not resign but work from home on some of the days in a week.</p>
<h2 id="first-few-days-and-months">First few days and months</h2>
<p>I started by working two days from home and each work-from-home-day turned out to be more productive than other three days in the office combined. I was pumping out code at a speed and accuracy which I had not experienced in the past. </p>
<p>Gradually, I started building what I can call a dream tech setup at home. Over few months, my home office became my santuary. It had everything I needed to feel productive. A big screen monitor, a high spec computer and most important, a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>Seeing how productive I was, my manager reached out with a suggestion of working more days from home. Other team members were also offered the same choice. Most of them took it. The overall performance of the team improved significantly. There were less distractions and minimum senseless meetings. Of course we missed the coffee runs and lunches but overall it was working out well for the company, team and individuals.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>As I got more into the routine of working from home, I realised that there were some new issues I had to face. Luckily these were dealt with easily. I will mention them here for the sake of completeness.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Distractions:</strong> As I was around the house, new types of distractions surfaced. On the top of the list was other people thinking that I'm available for a casual chat or a chore. I explained to my wife and kids that when I'm working from home, I'm still working and I cannot be available for anything else. Unless there is an emergency, I don't want to know about it. Any thing which needs to be discussed should be discussed when my work day is over. Linked to this is the second issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boundaries:</strong> After few days, I realised that the boundaries between work time and home time blurred. I'd be on the computer until late in the afternoon and then hop back on after dinner. Initially it felt good that I can finish the thing I was working on after spending some time with family. If I happen to be working on a hard problem after dinner then it would cause sleep issues. I'd be so charged up trying to solve an issue that sleep became a struggle. One day, I decided that this has to stop and I started turning the computer off when the day's work was done. By doing this, I resolved the sleep issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-can-make-wfh-work">What can make WFH work</h2>
<p>There are few things which I have learned are important to make working from home a success.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong> This I think is the most important. You need an environment which is separate from rest of the living space. A separate room is the best. However, it does not have to be. A dedicated space can be a home office during the day as long as there are no distractions. I luckily have a room in the house which is my home office. You also need to make the environment which suites you best to do work. For me, I like to have some plants around me and not so cluttered desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> You need the right tools. A high-spec webcam with a good sound system is a must. If you are into headphones then a good noise cancelling headphone will serve you well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> Not everyone likes to listen to music while working but for me it is very important. When I start coding, I always turn on some Lofi beats or chill out music. It just gets me into the zone. The music becomes a que and the brain quickly goes into full concentration mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Walks:</strong> Sitting all day on a chair is no fun at all. I have made it a habit to go on walks after lunch and after the work has finished. This can be very relaxing. It changes the scenery and the mood.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-present-and-the-future">The present and the future</h2>
<p>What started as a few days working from home turned into fully working remotely for me. Over the years, I have also realized that for the kind of work I do, an office is not required. I have a setup at home which no office can provide. And my productivity is at all time high.</p>
<p>For the future, my intention is to continue working from home. These days I reject contracts which require me to come to the office. If things turn and going to office is forced upon me, then I will most do something else. What will that be? I don't know but I also don't think about it too much. </p>
<p>Work From Home is here to stay for me.</p>
