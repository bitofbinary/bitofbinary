My rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…

I got interested in Mongolian history and [Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan) after watching a brilliant series called [Marco Polo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(TV_series)>) on Netflix. After watching the series, I wanted to know more about Genghis Khan who was the founder of one of the greatest empires ever. I also wanted to be entertained so I picked up the historical fiction Conqueror series written by Conn Iggulden. These are my reflections on the first book in the series titled Wolf of the Plains.

In the beginning was a tribe commanded by a powerful figure who seemed to have everything under control. Everything was going well until the turn of events which changed everything for the tribe and the leaderâ€™s family. A family found itself in the most difficult circumstances with one singular goal which was to survive.

A young boy after going through the severe hardship ended up in situations where he almost died. Gradually the ruthlessness became a dominating trait and the desire to avenge became the goal of his life. After destroying the enemies, he set out to do something far bigger than just revenge. He set his eyes on ruling all the known land. And he did.

I found the book so interesting that I found it hard to put down. While reading, I also came across a bunch of mental models.

- Overconfidence (by the people against whom Temujin took his revenge)
- Collaboration
- Change

There are five books in the series and Iâ€™m looking forward to reading them all.

Happy reading.
