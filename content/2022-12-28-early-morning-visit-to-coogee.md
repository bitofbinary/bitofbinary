Walking on the beach at sunrise can be an excellent start to the day. The freshness of ocean breeze and looking at the sun when it is right above the horizon makes you appriciate the beauty of the planet and for me the beauty of the city I live in. Coogee beach in Sydney is one such place we love visiting. 

Today we decided to get to the beach early in the morning to see the sunrise. We missed the sunrise by 10 minutes but still had a wonderful morning. On the way back we stopped at another Kiribilli for breakfast and did a half walk across the Harbour Bridge. 

These are some of the shots I took at Coogee beach.
