# The Polymath: Unlocking the Power of Human Versatility by Waqas Ahmed

This book advocates Polymathy over specialization.

Some of the most famous Polymaths such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin and such we all recognise. However there are many more who are not that famous and remain in obsecurity.

Polymath are not know-it-all individuals.

They are courious and ask a lot of Why questions

Steve Jobs is identified as a Polymath. He was a visionary and beyond excellent businessman. But Polymath? I don't know about that. Tim Ferris is also mentioned as polymath. Right!

There were times when I felt that either the author does not understand what Polymathy is or he is mentioning people just to score brownie points with them. The ones who are living of course. 

I was expecting more from this book than what was delivered. I was looking for some deep insights rather than an enumeration of polymaths page after page.


Personally, I have always desired to be more of a generalist than a specialist but because of the reasons mentioned in the book, I had to specialize.
