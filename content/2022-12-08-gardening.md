I did a major cleanup of my digital [garden](/garden) today. In the process I learned many new things about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). For example, how to get a section in a template.

```
{% set garden_section = get_section(path="garden/_index.md") %}
```

It feels like things are coming along for the knowledge repository I'm trying to create here. 

Also added a page for a book I have been reading [The Polymath](garden/books/the-polymath).
