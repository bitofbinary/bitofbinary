I did a major cleanup of my digital [garden](/garden) today. In the process I learned many new things about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). For example, how to get a section in a template.

```
{% set garden_section = get_section(path="garden/_index.md") %}
```

It feels like things are coming along for the knowledge repository I'm trying to create here. 

Added a page for a book I have been reading [The Polymath](garden/books/the-polymath).

Also read an intresting article by Debashis Basu titled [Has SEBI Lost the Battle against Finfluencers and Illegal Advisers?](https://www.moneylife.in/article/has-sebi-lost-the-battle-against-finfluencers-and-illegal-advisers/69097.html)

Few months ASIC identified this as an issue and came out with [guidelines](https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/discussing-financial-products-and-services-online/) for those who discuss financial products and services oneline.
