This mini project of mine will most likely be the kind which yields minimum benefit for the effort. However, it is still something I'd like to get into.

I have decided to undertake such mini projects to keep myself busy with something other than programming. I may have more to write about these mini projects later.

I have been reading books since many years and there have been times when I would read one book after another for months. There were also times when I would not pick up a book. A lot of reading happened on my commute to and from work and I figured that it was the best way to spend the commute time.

Whenever I finish a book and if it is a printed copy (they mostly are), I write the date I finished reading it on the last page. I don't know how I got into this habit but it is something I have been doing it for year. Of course with no purpose.
