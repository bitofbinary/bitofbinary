I have been a professional programmer for more than two decades now. Most of my work has been around web development. I started by writing static websites then progressed to classic ASP. I worked with Coldfusion, ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC and in last five or so years, React.

Around 2010, I worked on a small project which was written in Ruby on Rails. By far, that was the best programming experience I have ever had.

Due to commercial reasons, I stayed with ASP and related crap but never forgot the Rails experience. Don't know why but Rails somehow did not become popular in Australian market at that time (circa 2010).

Recently, I made an executive decision of learning new things which are outside my comfort zone. I did a self survey and came up with a list of things I'd like to learn. They are:

1. Clojure
2. Haskell
3. Ruby and Ruby on Rails
4. Python and Django

I thought deep about this and decided that I should learn something which hopefully will be more **fun** than others. Hence Ruby on Rails.

I am also trying something I have never done before i.e. write about what I learn. Sort of [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I plan to write unstructured posts about whatever I learn on this RoR journey.

Here are few not too rigid rules I will follow:

1. **Fun** is the keyword. If it ever becomes **not fun** then I will just abandon it and move to something else
2. I'm doing this only for my own enjoyment and curiosity
3. If at anytime I feel that point 2 is not materializing, I will pull the plug on entire plan

One will notice that the gist of the three points above is the same. That is intentional.

I think the time has come to end the ramblings and get on with the plan.

See you sometime in the future.
