My rating: ★★★

Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe is about natives of Australia also known as [Aboriginals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians). It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers who lived a nomadic life. They did not have engineering capabilities, never build houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.
