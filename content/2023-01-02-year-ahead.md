New Year resolutions are dumb. I made them for many years to witness them crumble within the first few days. They are the wrong device to use for mmmm! anything. With that in mind, I write these notes to myself. You and me already know that these are resolutions in disguise. Old habits die hard.

## Learning 

I start many courses online and most of them lay unfinished. However, in 2022, I finished a course on digital photography on LinkedIn Learning and last Black Friday sale, I bought the Ruby and Ruby on Rails course from Pragmatic Studio which I'm going through and having fun going through it.

I have always enjoyed writing Ruby code but somehow I have never pursued a job writing Ruby. I plan to change this and find a contract where I work on Ruby on Rails. I don't understand why some people find it RoR hard, to me it makes total sense. I am at a point where I find RoR and Django to be the most complete and sensible frameworks to write web applications or APIs.

The learning in this area shall continue as long as it remains fun.

## Reading

To me reading is a lot of things. It is a hobby, a stress reliever, boredom buster and the best return on the time spent. It is hard to find a pursuit which gives delivers all these things. Yet, somehow I did not do much of it. These are the only books I read last year.

1. Dark Emu
2. Wolf of the Plains
3. How to Take Smart Notes
4. Richer, Wiser, Happer
5. The Rebel Allocator
6. Deep Survival
7. Viral
8. TITAN
9. Breath
10. The Polymath

The number does not matter at all, but this is embarrassing. I'm sure that I can do better.


## Health

Let's start with a confession. I have sinned and my sin is gluttony. Ever since I started cooking myself, I have became more of a foodie than I was. This has started to show around the belly. My plan is to consume only 1 full meal a day which includes carbs. Other two will be broken up into smaller meals of mostly healthy food such as fruits, yoghurt, nuts etc. 

Exercise is another area which needs to be worked on 2023. I somehow could never make it a part of my day and I plan to change this. Maybe I could apply lessons I learned form Atomic Habits.

## Travel

Last few years have not been too good on travel side. When I did travel, it was because of family emergencies or taking care of things. Hopefully this year will be different. I have already made plans for some travel in the first and second quarter of this year. I'll post photos if those trips materialize.

Now this is already becoming longer that I expected. I think I'll end it here. 

Happy New Year.
