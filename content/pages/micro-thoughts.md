During the day, many thoughts come across my mind. Some of these are interesting enough (to me) to be catalogued and revisited. 

- The reason why something like ChatGPT did not come out of Google is because Google has a lens through which they see everything new. That lens is the advertising business. Google has spent more energy in trying to figure out how to make money from ML/AI/LLMs then on the innvotation itself. This is just a natural cycle of businesses. Microsoft seems to be unique.

- Interesting to me may not be interesting to you. Is the quality of interesting, intrinsic?
