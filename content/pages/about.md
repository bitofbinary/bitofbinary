Hi! I'm Deepak.

Iâ€™m on a lifelong journey of progressively trying to be less wrong.

I write software for fun and profit. I have been doing this for more than twenty years and it has been a wonderful journey.

I have also been an aspiring generalist since many years, and this too is a lot of fun.

Other than programming, my interests are reading <a href="/bookshelf">books</a>, holidaying with my family and cooking.

According to 16personalities, my personality type is [Logician INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)

Take what you will from this. All I can say is that it is not completely wrong. [Strengths and Weaknesses](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-strengths-and-weaknesses) are of particular interest.

This website is built using the awesome [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator and it is hosted on Github pages.
