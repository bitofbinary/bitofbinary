## Editors

- [Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) Emacs is better than VIM is better than Emacs is better than...
- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/) Nothing comes close to the power of VIM once you have learned how to exit out of it
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Everyone is using it so it must be good. Remember the saying about millions of flies?

## Shell

- [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Oh my Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and a bunch of useful plugins. Oh my!

## Terminal

- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) Fast and furious
- [MacOs Terminal](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/monterey/) Scrolling is better

## Multiplexer

- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is like an addiction

## Colorscheme

- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) everywhere (mostly)
