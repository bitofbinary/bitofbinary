My napkin math on how much time we have for reading throughout our life and how can we use it best.

Assuming that one lives upto 70 years.

Subtract the first 15 years for learning how to read and developing an interest in reading.

Also, take away 5 years of old age for decline in cognitive abilities.

This gives us 50 years. 

If a person reads for an hour everyday, we get to 18,250 hours.

50 X 365 X 1

How many books can be read in this time? 

Let's average out 20 hours per book.

This gives us 912 books in lifetime.
