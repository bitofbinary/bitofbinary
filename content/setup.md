## Operating System and hardware

MacOS on Macbook air with M1 chip.

## Editors

- **Nvim** Nothing comes close to the power of VIM once you have learned how to exit out of it.
- **VSCode** Everyone is using it so it must be good. Remember the saying about million flies?

## Shell

- **Z shell** with Oh my Zsh and a bunch of useful plugins

## Terminal

- **Alacritty** Fast and furious
- **MacOs Terminal** Scrolling is better

## Multiplexer

- **Tmux** is like an addiction

## Colorscheme

- **Gruvbox** everywhere (mostly)
- **Nord** when I fantasise about travelling to Norway
