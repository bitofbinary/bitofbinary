## Operating System and hardware

MacOS on Macbook air with M1 chip.

## Editors

- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/) Nothing comes close to the power of VIM once you have learned how to exit out of it
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Everyone is using it so it must be good. Remember the saying about millions of flies?

## Shell

- [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Oh my Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and a bunch of useful plugins

## Terminal

- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) Fast and furious
- MacOs Terminal Scrolling is better

## Multiplexer

- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is like an addiction

## Colorscheme

- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) everywhere (mostly)
- [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) when I fantasise about travelling to Norway
