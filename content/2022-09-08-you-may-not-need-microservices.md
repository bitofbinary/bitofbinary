You most likely don't need microservices.

Fad is defined as

> an intense and widely shared enthusiasm for something, especially one that is short-lived; a craze.

When it comes to programming or application architecture, the definition is spot on. Maybe the short-lived part can be removed.

Since last few years, I have noticed the use of microservices as the goto architecture for back-end services. Although the infection has now crept up in the front-end world too. Micro-frontends? Seriously?

But let's stick to microservices for now.

You may not need them because you don't have those problems to which are solved by microservices. You are not Netflix, Google, Facebook...

Stop pretending that you are. Oh yes, and when/if you do become that big, then you will have an army of engineers to deal with it.

There, I said it.

Now go embrace a monolith.
