## Welcome to my digital garden ðŸª´

What is a digital garden?

It is a place where I put my notes, observations, thoughts etc.

It is a repository of things I come across and find interesting

It is a learning tool tailored specifically for me. It may or may not be useful to you

It is a personal Wiki
