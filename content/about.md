Iâ€™m on a lifelong journey of progressively trying to be less wrong.

Hi! I'm Deepak.

I'm a software engineer by profession. I have been doing this programming thing for more than twenty years now and it has been a wonderful journey.

Other than programming, my interests are reading books, holidaying with my family and cooking.
