Iâ€™m on a lifelong journey of progressively trying to be less wrong.

Hi! I'm Deepak.

I'm a software engineer by profession. I have been doing this programming thing for more than twenty years now and it has been a wonderful journey.

Other than programming, my interests are reading <a href="/books">books</a>, holidaying with my family and cooking.

According to 16personalities, my personality type is [Logician INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)

Take what you will from this. All I can say is that is not completely wrong. [Strengths and Weaknesses](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-strengths-and-weaknesses) are of particular interest.
