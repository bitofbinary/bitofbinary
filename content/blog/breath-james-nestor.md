Breath: The new science of a lost art by James Nestor.

What is one activity that we do constantly from the moment we are born to the second we die? The answer is breathing.

In the hierarchy of importance, breathing is way on top above everything else. Think about it. Without breathing there is no you and without you, there is nothing.

Sadly, I did not think too much about breathing until I read this book. I have been aware of breathing techniques such as [pranayam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama) but I never looked into it's benefits or practiced it. This book changed that for me.

The author describes (not in too much detail) many breathing techniques. I was able to practice few of them while reading. I thought, that there is no equipment required or any special arrangement and I have got everything I need to try it out. So, I made it a habit to breath slowly with longer exhales while I was reading.

There were few things I noticed in me while I did slow, deep breathing. I generally felt lighter and happier. I also noticed a change in my energy levels which were high after focused breathing. Overall, I was in a good mood.

These results created a positive feedback loop and I have made it a habit to breath conciously, slowly and deeply.

It could be one of the most important books I have read.
