Einstein His Life and Universe is one of the best biographies I have read. 

After reading it, I have gained more understanding of Einstein as a physicist and as a person. On one hand are these unparalleled achievements in Physics and on the other are the complexities of a person who is just like any other bloke.

I particularly enjoyed reading about his quest to figure out general relativity and then in his older years, his work on unified theory which did not yield any results. 


Einstein was a rebel of Physics in his younger days and then as he got older, he became more of a traditionalist with his views on Quantum Mechanics.

The book was so well written that I read slowly as I got to some of the last chapters. He life story was so captivating for me that I did not want the book to end.

This was the second biography I read by Walter Isaacson. The first was Jobs. I did not think too much about Jobs (the biography), but Einstein (the biography) was superb.
