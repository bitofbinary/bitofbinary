I was installing Ruby version 3.1.2 on my machine by running

```bash
asdf install ruby 3.1.2
```

I got this error

```bash
ruby-build: definition not found: 3.1.2
```

The way to fix it is by updating the ruby plugin for asdf

```bash
asdf plugin-update ruby
```

I have been using asdf to manage multiple versions of Ruby. I prefer it over rvm and rbenv. I have always had issues with those two.
