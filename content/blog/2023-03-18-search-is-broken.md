My first introduction to Google was in January 2000 during a class I was teaching. One of the students who was a scientist at CSIRO mentioned a website called Google and praised it's search capabilities. Up until then my go to search engines were Yahoo, Alta Vista, Ask Jeeves and few others. I remember my first visit to google.com and conducting a search on something. I do not rememeber what I searched for but it must have been something related to Visual Basic. I was immediately impressed by what the search engine came back with. Since then, Google has been my default search engine. I will once in a while go to duckduckgo but 99.9999% of time, it is Google.

But since last few years, I have observed that the search is broken and Google broke it. No, I'm not talking about the advances made by GPT and how Microsoft may have got itself the ticket to being a search monopoly as Google is at present. No, I'm talking about the plain old search engine. The one you rely on to give you the links which are the best match for your search query. And that is broken.

When I search for something these days, majority of the links on the first page are links to content farms or articles written by companies to promote their products. The later is not always disappointing. I know of some companies which write great content to promote related services they offer. They are exeptions. Mostly it is just a pile of garbage with the purpose of somehow getting you to visit their pathetic website.

With all that flattery out of the way, let's get to the point of this article. 

The search is broken and Google broke it.
