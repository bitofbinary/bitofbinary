## Thinking about

Importance of working smart vs working hard in an organisational environment. This thought originated while thinking about a recent interaction in which the volume of my output was discussed. I wrote some code in last few weeks which will save the team hundreds of hours of agonising troubleshooting in the near future. It was not appropriately estimated. How do you estimate such an effort?
