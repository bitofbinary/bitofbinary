## Key points

The book is about natives of Australia also known as Aboriginals. It is a popular belief that Aboriginals were mostly hunter gatherers and lived a nomadic life. They did not have any engineering capabilities, never built houses, were not into agriculture and mostly did not do things that a civilized society would. This book challenges such beliefs and presents a different view based on documented observations by early Europeans and recent findings.
