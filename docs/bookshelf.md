# Bookshelf

Leave me alone with a book and the concept of time goes into a state of non-existence for me.

I enjoy reading books on anything and everything. Some of my favourite subjects are

1. Finance and Investments
2. Business
3. History
4. Technology (Mostly computers and programming)
5. Biographies (Technically not a subject)
6. Classics
