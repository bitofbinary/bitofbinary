# About this site

### Technology

This website is built using [Docausaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

I know [React](https://reactjs.org/) well so setting it up with Docusaurus was easy for me. Customisation of Docusaurus is also fun. 

### Hosting

The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The cost is $0. I think the price is just right :)
