# About

I am a software developer. I convert ideas into useable digital products. Over the years, I have worked with a range of technologies, enjoyed writing code in a variety of languages and mostly had a ball doing it.

These days, I am focusing on **Golang**, **Typescript**, **React** and **AWS**.

On this website, I write about things I find interesting.

Thanks for visiting.
