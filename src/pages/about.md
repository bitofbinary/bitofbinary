# About

In the early days of World Wide Web, there were these websites called portals. These portals on their homepage categorised information in broad topics. I got into the habit of randomly picking up a topic and browsing it for hours. I would discover things I did not know existed, find interesing places and learn from all the interesting web pages people were putting up. This started a journey of learning and increasing my knowledge about the world.

Another joyful habit I picked up in my early years was reading books on pretty much everything and anything that interests me.

This website is a place where I try to write my sporadic thoughts as I try to figure [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World) out.
