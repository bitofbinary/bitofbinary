# About me

Professionally, I am a software developer. I convert ideas into useable digital products. Over the years, I have worked with a range of technologies, enjoyed writing code in a variety of languages and mostly had a ball doing it.

These days, I am focusing on **Golang**, **Typescript**, **React** and **AWS**.

# About this website

In the early days of World Wide Web, I was lucky enough to have access to a computer in my house. Connecting to Internet (via dial-up modem) was my goto activity. I got into the habit of randomly picking up a topic and exploring it for hours. I would discover things I did not know existed, find interesting places and learn from all the interesting web pages people were putting up. This started a journey of learning and increasing my knowledge about the world.

Another joyful habit I picked up in my early years was [reading books](/bookshelf) on pretty much everything and anything that interests me.

This website is a place where I try to write my [sporadic thoughts](/garden) as I try to figure [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World) out. Here you will find a [digital garden](/garden) and a [stream](/stream).

Thanks for visiting.
