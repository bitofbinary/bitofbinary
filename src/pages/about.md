# About

I am a software developer. I convert ideas into useable digital products. Over the years, I have worked with a range of technologies, enjoyed writing code in a variety of languages and mostly had a ball doing it.

These days, I am focusing on **Golang**, **Typescript**, **React** and **AWS**.

This website is a place where I try to write my [sporadic thoughts](/garden) as I try to figure [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World) out. Here you will find a [digital garden](/garden) and a [stream](/stream).

A joyful habit I picked up in my early years was reading books on pretty much everything and anything that interests me. I invite you to checkout my [bookshelf](/bookshelf).

Thanks for visiting.
