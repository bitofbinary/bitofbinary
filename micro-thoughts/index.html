<ul>
<li>
<p>The reason why something like ChatGPT did not come out of Google is because Google has a lens through which they see everything new. That lens is the advertising business. Google has spent more energy in trying to figure out how to make money from ML/AI/LLMs then on the innvotation itself. This is just a natural cycle of businesses. Microsoft seems to be unique.</p>

<p>Interesting to me may not be interesting to you. Is the quality of interesting, intrinsic?</p>
